2. Inside the project folder there will be a `requirements.txt` file containing all the packages that need to be installed to run the Django app.
This is based on a previous project I did, and we may not end up using them all<br><br>
Install them using the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br><br>


3. Finally, run the server with: `python manage.py runserver`<br><br>
Type in `localhost:8000` in your browser to access the site<br>
Quit the server with CONTROL-C (COMMAND-C on MacOS) in the terminal
